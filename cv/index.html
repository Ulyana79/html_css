            <p>Hello. My name is Ulyana. Some time ago I finished software testing courses. I started testing sites on my own. After the courses, I started learning html and css on my own, read Kulikov's book "Software Testing" and many articles on websites habr.com and software-testing.ru. </p>

            <p>But I wanted to gain experience on a real project, working in a team. So I found courses with internships. As part of this course, I spent two months on an internship and tested a web application using the GUI and Google Chrome Dev Tools, got acquainted with the Selenium IDE and the basics of sql. The work took place in a team. I wrote a lot of test cases, checklists, found 16 bugs and issued bug reports on them. I also wrote 10 suggestions for improving the site. All test documentation (test cases, bug reports, test reports) was processed in the Jira bug tracking system.</p>

            <p>I also successfully completed the "Learn python" courses, where I got acquainted with the basics of the programming language, learned basic commands in the Linux terminal and work in the Git version control system. At the end of the course, I wrote a project "Site Parser" and a simple telegram bot. Now I continue to study Python for further use in writing autotests.</p>
